#### Raising REST exceptions
I can't decide if this is the "right" way of doing this, but it seems relatively succinct, so I'll attempt to describe how I handled exceptions for a REST api in django.

Say you need to return user info and the info given for user lookup fails.
    
    import users
    import exceptions
    import rest_exceptions as rest_excs
    import decorators.rest as rest
    
    @rest.exceptions
    def get_user_info(input_name):
    try:
        user = users.get_user(input_name)
    except exceptions.NoSuchUser
        raise rest_exc.NoSuchUser
    ...


- The `exceptions` import is for general error catching and it allows you to collect all your exception definitions for specific modules.
- `decorators.rest` holds... well, decorator functions specific to REST stuff. You don't need a separate directory `decorators` but I happened to have more decorator types than were sensible to put in the main modules dir..
- `rest_exceptions` is similar to exceptions but these will need to define a status code to return and inherit from a exception class we define called `RestException`

####Exception Decorator
So, catch the general exception, raise the REST exception... but then what?
This is where the decorator comes in. It handles when a rest exception is raised and returns an appropriate response.

You'd define the base exception class, `RestException` as:

    class RestException(Exception):
        code = 500
        message = {"reason" : "failed"}
        response = None

Define all the specific exceptions with this as the base class (ex. `PermissionDenied(RestException)`).  This way you can specify the status code and response for each type of exception.

The JSONResponse object:

Basically just returning an HttpResponse encoded properly as json. You'd want to check kwargs for a status as well.

If multiple modules have a REST api this would help to generalize the exception handling. I'm sure there are other/better ways of doing this and I'd love to know what they are. Even if it is a crap way of doing it, maybe you can use the idea to implement something else. 

#####Bottom line: Decorators are fun
